        bandBio: 'Queens of the Stone Age (commonly abbreviated QOTSA) is an American rock band formed in 1996 in Palm Desert, California. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Josh Homme, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line-up changes. The current line-up consists of Homme alongside Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, keyboard, percussion, backing vocals), Michael Shuman (bass guitar, keyboard, backing vocals), Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, percussion, backing vocals), and Jon Theodore (drums, percussion). The band also have a large pool of contributors and collaborators.[1] Queens of the Stone Age are known for their blues, Krautrock and electronica-influenced style of riff-oriented and rhythmic hard rock music, coupled with Homme\'s distinct falsetto vocals and unorthodox guitar scales.',

        bandBio: 'Dungen is a Swedish rock band based in Stockholm. Often classified as psychedelic rock, Dungen is also influenced by Swedish (and other) folk music, classic rock, progressive rock, garage rock and alternative rock.The band is fronted by singer/ composer Gustav Ejstes, who writes all music and plays the majority of instruments on the band\'s records. Despite this, Dungen plays live as a four-piece. Ejstes, who in his teens started his songwriting with hip hop, is backed live by Swedish progressive rock veteran Reine Fiske (Landberk, Morte Macabre, Paatos, The Amazing) on guitar, bassist Mattias Gustavsson (Life On Earth!), and drummer Johan Holmegard (previously on drums was Fredrik Björling), all of whom have played parts on Dungen\'s studio albums.',

        bandBio: 'Slift are a French trio who combine the ethos and aesthetic trappings of garage rock with cosmic atmosphere and mantra-like repetition. I was introduced to them via their 2018 album, La Planète Inexplorée. That album was great, and Ummon took everything I loved about it and cranked it up even harder.Ummon is not a record for the faint of heart.It’s 72 minutes of garage- kraut - doom(or maybe doom - garage - kraut) with barely any breathing room.Huge, abrasive walls of guitar dominate this record, while chaotic bursts of noise pummel the listener.The band members themselves give fair warning on how key repetition is to this album’s sound on their Bandcamp page(or, as they phrase it, “r r e e p p e e t t i i t t i i o o n n”).With all this in mind, if you’re willing to give it a shot, this album is highly rewarding.',
